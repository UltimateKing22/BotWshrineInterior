        <p class="WhyExistanceText">There are many cases in high level Breath of the Wild where you need to see the inside of a shrine, but either don't have it unlocked or don't feel like going onto the game to look. For instance, Komali runs a competetion where players attempt to speedrun a shrine with certain limitations, such as banning use of the left joystick. In order to route the shrine without using the game, a set of images can be very useful. While primarily being made for routing and observing, there is also a tutorial for the shrine, as well as a set of advanced strategies that could be used to circumvent the normal challenge or route a run.</p>
